# Sprint 4

**Goal**: For sprint 4, continued focus was put on getting key features pushed out

- Have separate users (anonymous and registered).
- Implement user actions, posting, editing, and deleting threads or posts (for registered users only).
- Create an api for users.

Note: We have scrapped the limit on posting.

**Participants**: All of 6 members participated: Kuan Yu Chu (Daniel), Shuai Wen Yu, Jiun Yenn Shyong (Patrick), Jason Yiu-Sum Chan, Patrick James Hogeveen, Rach Ilagan

**Spikes**: No spikes are explicitly identified for this sprint. All members were familiar with the technology that they were using.

**Team Capacity**: Sprint 4 has a total capacity of 23 points, which is 1 point lower than the previous sprint. The team focused on key features to make our application viable for production, hence the lower capacity.

**User Stories and Tasks**: The user stories are decided based on our release goal, which is to be able to be able

- Create and view threads and posts either as an anonymous user or account holder.
- We will be working on stories that allow us to create and view posts and threads on the page, the delay system for posting anonymously, and account management stories.
- Since most of the stories are straight-forward in ths sprint, tasks will not be necessary for all of them.
