# Sprint 4 Retrospective Meeting

**Participants:** Kuan Yu Chu (Daniel), Shuai Wen Yu, Jiun Yenn Shyong (Patrick), Jason Yiu-Sum Chan, Patrick James Hogeveen, Rach Ilagan

## What were the good practices

- Git flow to help organize the branches and merges.
- Weekly meetings in person or on discord.
- Consistent discussion of UI/UX design.
- Sharing snippets of code on discord for faster feedback.
- Standups were more consistent.

## What were the bad practices

- Sprint was planned in a rush and not very well thought-out.
- User account story should've been done earlier
- Some member didn't participate in discussions.

## What are some possible improvements if we have another sprint

- Share and discuss coding style and knowledge
- Actually try to code something together live.

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 4

- Should not have left account user stories until the last. We had other stories that depended on it and was not able to finish the limit posting story.
