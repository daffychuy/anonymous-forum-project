  Initially, our team relied on Discord to communicate and organize team meetings. We were able to bounce ideas off each other for project ideas and eventually agreed on the project. In general, communication between all team members was consistent but we had trouble getting everyone on the same call at the same time due to scheduling conflicts. We eventually found a compromise and groomed/estimated all the user stories together. 

Working on the .md files together allowed us to experiment different ways of working together. We mostly did a great job in communicating what each other is responsible for and what we're currently working on. Going forward, we should rely on Jira more when managing our work.

  
  - Reflect on how your team worked together
  - How did you organize the team?
  - What tools did we use?
  

**Decision making**
  
   Our first step in making a decision is identifying and agreeing on the problem to be solved. The next step is to gather information to make a decision based on facts and data instead of assumptions. Information gathering was done by sharing our experiences and researching online. Once we have enough information, we woud propose possible soutions and weigh the differences in terms of how it affects our target audience and our workload. Finally, we would agree on a solution and document it. 
  
**Prioritizing user stories:**
  We were all very clear that user stories that affect the most basic functionality of our app should come first, such as the database, APIs, and functions related to posting. Our next priority is to make sure our anonymous posting works as expected with our spam prevention functions.
  
  
  
  As a baseline for estimating, we drew on tasks that we are all familiar with. For example, we agreed that a user story such as "Adding a drop down box in the sign-up page" is 0.5, and "Create CRUD APIs" is 13. The estimates were done after discussion the work required base on one of our experiences. Each story took 1 or 2 rounds of voting and outliers described their reasoning before we moved on to vote again.
  
  - How did we define priority and points? 
  - How many rounds of voting?
  

**Meetings**
   - In person or online?
  - How frequent?
  
**Next phase**
  
  Going forward, we need to do a better job at updating each other on our own task in the scrum channel. We also need to be checking daily to update or workflow. We will also be usign git-flow to manage commits.
  - What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
