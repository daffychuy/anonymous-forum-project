  Initially, our team relied on Discord to communicate and organize team meetings. We were able to bounce ideas off each other for project ideas and eventually agreed on the project. In general, communication between all team members was consistent but we had trouble getting everyone on the same call at the same time due to scheduling conflicts. We eventually found a compromise and groomed/estimated all the user stories together. 

Working on the .md files together allowed us to experiment different ways of working together. We mostly did a great job in communicating what each other is responsible for and what we're currently working on. Going forward, we should rely on Jira more when managing our work.

  
  - Reflect on how your team worked together
  - How did you organize the team?
  - What tools did we use?
  

**Decision making **
  - How did we make decisions?

**Prioritizing user stories:**
  - How did we define priority and points? 
  - How many rounds of voting?
  

**Meetings**
   - In person or online?
  - How frequent?
  
**Next phase**
  
  Going forward, we need to do a better job at updating each other on our own task in the scrum channel. We also need to be checking daily to update or workflow. We will also be usign git-flow to manage commits.
  - What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
