### Guidelines:

    Methods of communication: Email, Discord and Phone (as shown above)

    Communication response times: Discord response is usually within the hour.

    Meetings: We will have in-person meetings at least once every other week somewhere on campus. Scrum meetings will 
    mostly be done online either using VoIP or discord chat. We will take turns to take minutes of our meetings because
    each of us will have implemented or be in the middle of implementing something and can talk to the rest of us about 
    their progress, algorithm, etc.

    Meetings Preparation: Preparation will be discussed before each meeting. Research is required for any feature/technical tool we want to implement.

    Version Control:
    	Things Not to Commit (Will all be included in .gitignore):
    		- temporary files (e.g. .swp)
    		- IDE specific folder/files (e.g. .idea/)
    		- Environment variables
    		- Any test files that are for personal tests and not for group/project tests
    	Content of log messages:
    		- Must include the features implemented/fixed
    		- Must follow "The seven rules of a great Git commit message" from (here)[https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/]
    		- In addition to the great git commit messages, we must also include the JIRA ticket number with the following format: [Issue #] Commit Message
    	- For every new feature and/or bug fixes, we must submit it as a pull request, and then at least two of us will 
        review the changes before merging to the master branch
    	- Everything will need to be done on a seperate branch, no one should commit to master. If someone commits to master, 
        we are forced to roll back to previous commits and branch off.

    Roles and Division:
    	- As decided among group members, Daniel will be the team leader (But of course scrum master will be the TA)
            - In order to divide tasks up, we will all communicate with each other to see what is doable in the specified 
            sprint, and estimate how long it will take each of us to do, with those in-mind we will first take people who are 
            interested in that part, and we will let the person do it; however we all must have equal work this is where
            Daniel will make sure that everyone including himself have a fair and equal workload.

    Submitting deliverables: Daniel and Patrick will check at the very least. Ideally we should all review anything that 
    gets submitted as the final sprint deliverable. Because, in a group project, all of us are a QA, so all of us should
    review code submits. Submissions should be ready at least 24 hours before the deadline to allow for any last minute 
    revisions.

    Contingency Planning: We need to make sure each member has a good documentation so we can pick up the work if 
    anyone drops the class for any reason. We will discuss any missed meetings or tasks at scrum meetings and retrospective
    to document causes and potential solutions. ALWAYS REFERENCE your work! Ask each other for help if you're stuck.
