Guidelines:
	Methods of communication: Email, Discord, Phone as shown above
	
	Communication response times: Discord is usually within the hour. 
	
	Meetings: Will have in-person meetings at least once every other week somewhere on campus. Scrums will mostly be done online either VoIP or discord chat. We will take turns to take minutes because
	each of us will have implemented or in the middle of implementing something and can talk to us about their progress, their algorithm etc.
	
	Meetings Preparation: Preparation will be discussed before each meeting. Research is required for any feature/technical tool we want to implement.
	
	Version Control:
		Things Not to Commit (Will all be included in .gitignore): 
			- temporary files (e.g. .swp)
			- IDE specific files (e.g. .idea/)
			- Any test files that is for personal testes and not group/project tests
		Content of log messages: 
			- Must include the features implemented/fixed
			- Must follow the 7 rules of a great Git commit message from (here)[https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/]
			- In addition to the great git commit messages, we must also include the JIRA ticket number with the following format: [Issue #] Commit Message
		- For every new feature and/or bug fixes, we must submit it as a pull request, and at least two of us will review the changes before merging to the master branch
		- Everything will need to be done on a branch, no one should commit to master. If someone commit to master, we are forced to roll back to previous commits and branch off.

	Roles and Division: We need to understand what each other's good at first, ideally we will want a team leader.
	
	Submitting deliverables: Daniel and Patrick will check at the very least. Ideally we should all review anything that gets submitted as the final sprint deliverable. Submission should be ready at least 24 hours before the deadline to allow for any last minute revisions.
	
	Contigency Planning: We need to make sure each member has a good documentation so we can pick up the work if anyone drops for any reason. We will discuss any missed meetings or tasks at scrums and retrospective to document causes and potential solutions. ALWASYS REFERENCE your work! Ask each other for help if you're stuck.
