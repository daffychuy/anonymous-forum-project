## Team Name: shibainu

Our project is an Internet forum with anonymous features. The main objective of our forum is providing a platform for users to communicate with each other without being limited by some TOS while keeping the forum appropriate and keeping users anonymous. We can keep an anonymous forum appropriate by having posts that are anonymously posted required to be approved by an admin.


**Key Users**  
Below are some key users that may use our forum (more detailed personas in Personas.pdf):    

- Jack Daniels: A high-achiever in his second-year university. He is pursuing a medical degree while serving as the Don of his residence. He is highly involved in the community and loves to learn and help others learn. He is not very familiar with the internet and often needs to ask someone for help with his computer.  
- Shirley Temple: A tech savvy Computer Science student who is very active on the internet but keeps to herself in person. She enjoys playing video games and watching anime and is very involved in online discussions. 
- Ethyl Don-Julio: A secondary school teacher who is close to retirement. Him and his wife are always looking for ways to take better care of their beloved dogs but can only rely on vets and pet shop staff. He also enjoys taking photographs of his dogs and is looking to spend more time experimenting with photography once he retires.

**Key Principles**  
As stated early, the main focus of forum is anonymity. This will allow privacy for users and students of our forum as would be able to ask questions and provide feedback without fear of punishment. Ontop of anonymity, we would also like to focus on ease of use. We have seen many forums with complicated posting mechanism that may even discourage users to post on their forums. We want to provide a service where users can easily ask questions, while not having to go through a sign-up process that may be complicated for some users.


**Key Scenarios**     
Since one of our main focuses on our forum is anonymity, it should be no suprise that most of our key scenarios focus on that feature. For example if a user had a question that needs to be answered, but they don’t want to register or give away their email address they can do so on our forum. Another scenario that may occur is when a user wants to give some kind of feedback to something (ie a post) but also don’t want to register, they can do so by simply replying without an account. A major scenario that may lead users to use our forum is that they want to be active on a forum but don’t want anyone to know their identity. 

**Intended audience**  
In our personas, we listed examples of some key users that may be wanting to use our forums. A more general description of users that may want to use our service may include someone who is outgoing and wants to get involved or shy people with low self-esteem that may take advantage of our anonymity to ask questions.
