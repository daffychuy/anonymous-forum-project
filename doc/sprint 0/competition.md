# Competition

**Existing Competion**

As we are doing forum software with anonymity in mind, we have a lot of competitors such as *Piazza*, *Discourse* (utm's forum), *mybb* (old utm forum), *xenforo*, *invision* etc. However they all lack a feature to be truly anonymous. 

For *piazza*, while there is an option to be fully anonymous, but by default, anonymous just means anonymous to classmates and not to your TA and instructors and none of the classes so far have enabled truly anonymous. 

Secondly, *Discourse*, a great Q&A forum which some may argue is better than *Piazza* with its better UI design and more functionality but in the end, it requires registration and you are nowhere near being anonymous. 

Then for *xenforo*, *mybb*, *invision* etc., a general multi-purpose forum, while provides a lot of functionality which includes private posting, themes, custom-addons, a marketplace etc. they also lack the fact that you cannot post without registering and you also cannot be anonymous to the public and moderators. 

Lastly, *reddit*, the only forum that closely resembles our forum in a way such that they can create a subreddit page to user's liking and we can create a subpage that have a full-fledge forum integrated but *reddit* also lack the feature of post without registering and post anonymously.
