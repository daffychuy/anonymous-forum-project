# Competition

**Existing Competion**

Since we are making internet forum, we have lots of competitors such as *Piazza*, *Discourse* (UTM's forum), *mybb* (UTM's old forum), *xenforo*, *invision*, *reddit*, etc. However they all lack a feature to be truly anonymous. 

For *piazza*, while there is an option to be fully anonymous, by default, anonymous is set to be "anonymous to classmates" and not to your TAs and instructors. While none of the classes so far have enabled truly anonymous, as professors may want to make students be liable to what they say on the board, in contrast, our application andby defualt enables anonymous posting, as no sign-up is required.

Secondly, *Discourse* is a great Q&A forum which some may argue is better than *Piazza* due to its better UI design and more functionality. But in the end it requires registration and you are nowhere near being anonymous. 

While for *xenforo*, *mybb*, *invision* etc., general multi-purpose forums, they provide a lot of functionalities which includes but not limited to private posting, themes, custom-addons, a marketplace etc. they also all lack the feature that you cannot post without registering. You also cannot be anonymous to the public and moderators. 

Lastly, *reddit*, a forum that closely resembles our forum in a way such that they can create a subreddit page to user's liking as on our program we can create a subpage that have a full-fledge forum integrated. But then again, *reddit* also lacks the feature of posting without registering or posting anonymously.
