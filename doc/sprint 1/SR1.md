# Sprint 1 retrospective meeting

**Participants:** Jason, Kuan Yu, Rach, Shuai, Patrick, Jiun Yenn  

**Unfinished:** Create put and delete API. All of the API for user accounts.

**What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint**
- Git flow
- Weekly meetings in person or on discord	

**What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint** 
- All review CoS before starting a story, dividing work more equally and assigning more tasks to individuals
- Having a proper github pull requests even when using git-flow
    - I.e. proper title that includes jira issue tag and the description of the actual work that was done
- Make sure we are all using git flow properly
- Use express swagger for API documentation so that we all know the proper endpoints (Specifically swagger-ui-express)
- Better documentation for code that may be hard to read or hard to understand in the first glance
- Proper test cases
- Meaningful updates on your tasks/stories assigned in the standup/discord.
- Add comments on the JIRA tickets for work done during the spring, any difficult problems encountered and their solution 
    - Anything that still needs to be done should also be documented at the end of the sprint 

**What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint**
- Some members didn’t test their code aka broken code.
- Chasing people down for standups.
- Leaving a task till the last few days when it should’ve been done earlier

**What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1**
- One person had to redo some API and test/fix everything. This should’ve been done as a team.
- We didn’t use git flow properly had had some merging issues/confusion
