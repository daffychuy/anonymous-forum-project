# Sprint 3 Planning Meeting

This document must clearly indicate the sprint goal, all
stories for this sprint clearly identified, team capacity recorded, participants are recorded, decisions
about user stories to be completed this sprint are clear, tasks breakdown is done.

**Goal**: For this sprint, we continute to focus on integrating our frontend with our backend to be able to perform basic functions that are expected of a forum:

- Display all subcategories and categories under the subpage.
- Create a thread and display all threads under a subcategory.
- Post in a thread and dispaly all posts in a thread

We also aim to implement the delay system for viewing threads and posts created by anonymous users, and account registration and login functions.

**Participants**: All of 6 members participated: Kuan Yu Chu (Daniel), Shuai Wen Yu, Jiun Yenn Shyong (Patrick), Jason Yiu-Sum Chan, Patrick James Hogeveen, Rach Ilagan

**Spikes**: No spikes are explicitly identified for this sprint. The member responsible for implementing PassportJS is already familiar with it.

**Team Capacity**: Sprint 3 will have a total capacity of 24 points, which is 2 points lower than the previous sprint. We expect there to be more fine-tuning with the UI perspective, hence the slightly lower capacity.

**User Stories and Tasks**: The user stories are decided based on our release goal, which is to be able to be able to create and view threads and posts either as an anonymous user or account holder. We will be working on stories that allow us to create and view posts and threads on the page, the delay system for posting anonymously, and account management stories. Since most of the stories are straight-forward in ths sprint, tasks will not be necessary for all of them.
