**Participants:** All members: Kuan Yu Chu (Daniel), Shuai Wen Yu, Jiun Yenn Shyong (Patrick), Jason Yiu-Sum Chan, Patrick James Hogeveen, Rach Ilagan

**Unfinished:**: None, all stories were finished this sprint.

## What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint

- Git flow to help organize the branches and merges.
- Weekly meetings in person or on discord.
- Consistent discussion of UI integration and design choice
- Sharing snippets of code on discord for faster feedback.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint

- Start preparing for the release demo. Think about assigning roles and features to demo.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint

- Some members still need to be remined of standups on a daily basis.
- One member did't participate much in discussions on discord.

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 3

- Overall sprint 3 was much smoother than the previous ones. Most members are actively engaged in discussions on discord with the except of one member. We had no major hiccups this sprint, although having to chase some members down for standups is not ideal.
- Had to chase members down to do merge reviews.
