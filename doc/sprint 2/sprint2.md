# Sprint 2 Planning Meeting

This document must clearly indicate the sprint goal, all
stories for this sprint clearly identified, team capacity recorded, participants are recorded, decisions
about user stories to be completed this sprint are clear, tasks breakdown is done.

**Goal**: For this sprint, our goal is the finish the basic CRUD functions of subpage, category, subcategory, thread and post. We will also implement Jest and SuperTest to automate testing.

**Participants**: All of 6 members participated: Kuan Yu Chu (Daniel), Shuai Wen Yu, Jiun Yenn Shyong (Patrick), Jason Yiu-Sum Chan, Patrick James Hogeveen, Rach Ilagan

**Spikes**: No spikes are explicitly identified for this sprint. However, each member is expected to learn Swagger, Jest and SuperTest to finish their respective API stories, if applicable.

**Team Capacity**: We will be discussing our team capacity in story points. The week of midterms will lower our team capacity, even with a reading week. We estimate that each member would be able to dedicate no more than 1 hour per day on their assigned stories/tasks. Keeping in mind that our Sprint 1 was 30 points, we've assigned no more than 5 points per member for this sprint. Therefore, the total capacity of sprint 2 should be roughly 25 points.
