# Sprint 2 Retrospective Meeting

**Participants:** All members: Kuan Yu Chu (Daniel), Shuai Wen Yu, Jiun Yenn Shyong (Patrick), Jason Yiu-Sum Chan, Patrick James Hogeveen, Rach Ilagan

**Unfinished:** "SHIB-55 Create and use SESSION with express" required APIs to be done. Moved to sprint 3

## What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint

- Git flow to help organize the branches and merges.
- Weekly meetings in person or on discord.
- Consistent discussion of API logic. We have finished the basics of the APIs and will require more fine tuning down the road
- Consistent discussion of DB model.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint

- Need to look at UI together and agree on the choices.
- Also need to understand how UI is going to work with backend.
- Share snippets of your code (both working and non-working) on discord to get faster feedback instead of waiting until the end.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint

- Some member still started too late.
- Certain issues could've been resolved before the demo if we found out faster.

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2

- Tough week with exams/midterms hampered the performance of our team.
